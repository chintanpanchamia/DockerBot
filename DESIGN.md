# Design Milestone

In this milestone, you will write a design proposal for a software engineering bot. That is, bad proposals *may be rejected* by the professor. So spend time in coming up with a good and crisp idea.

The proposal will be structured to include the following items:

* Problem Statement
* Bot Description
* Design Sketches
* Architecture Design
* Additional Patterns

You will also be working in a team of students. Remember to [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YY2Qrfp_s81xSmzUSHv0TckhKFPWymbymgcHcxJboMc/edit#gid=0) for teams.

## Problem Statement

Remember, we are solving problems in the software engineering domain. This does not include problems, such as finding a parking spot, but it may include problems such as forgetting api tokens, drudgery associated with manually creating REST calls, difficulty in executing certain command lines tools, or not wanting to wake up at 3am to restart a server that crashed. 

What is the problem? *Why* is it a problem?

This should only be a good paragraph or two.

## Bot Description

What does your bot do? Why is a bot a good solution for the problem?
Does your bot have a converstation with users (e.g. hubot), or does it just response to events (e.g., coveralls bot on github)? Does your bot fit in one of the categories we talked about in class? A code drone vs documentation bot?

This should be a good two paragraphs.

### Design Sketches

* Create a wireframe mockup of your bot in action.
* Create a storyboard that illustrates the primary task that a user undergoes with bot.

## Architecture Design

* Create a diagram that illustrates the components of your bot, the platform it is embedded in, third party services it may use, data storage it may require, etc.
* Describe the architecture components in text. This should be a few paragraphs.
* Describe any constraints or guidelines that should be established in building software for your architecture (e.g., a bot cannot send data from one user to another user).

### Additional Patterns

Describe any additional design patterns that may be relevant for your bot design.

## Submission

Create a team repository for your bot.  Add a DESIGN.md document with the following materials included. Submit [here](https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqhY8NV4FLWfhpI2GybudLsa-b_2fsrIjnSrAuvnlPMR1Xfw/viewform).

### Deliverables

* Problem Statement (25%)
* Bot Description (15%)
* Design Sketches (30%)
* Architecture Design + Additional Patterns (30%)

**DUE:** THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, Midnight.
